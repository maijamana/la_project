Frequency domain of an image and its applications, Linear Algebra project

Image denoising is a component of digital image processing, aiming to enhance the visual quality of images by reducing noise originating from various sources such as environmental conditions or camera sensor issues. The primary aim of our project is to research different denoising methods primary Fourier-based to denosise images while preserving and restoring important information from noisy input.


The research area of our project lies within the domain of image processing. During image acquisition and transmission susceptibility to noise corruption in digital images arises. Noise appears as undesirable grainy areas, leading to a degradation of image quality and loss of important information. Hence, the task of image denoising emerges, with the primary objective being the elimination of noise from an image, thus introducing a new challenge: preserving critical information such as edges and textures while preventing artifacts and blurring. The aim of our project is to compare the efficacy of Fourier-based denoising methods with other techniques.
